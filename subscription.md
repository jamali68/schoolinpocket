# Subscription

![e-School SaaS](../static/images/schooladmin/free-trial.png)

- If a school does not have any active package, they can buy a package from subscription->plans as shown in the image.

- School admins can buy a trial package if enabled by the super admin. Trial packages can only be purchased once. If a school has bought any other package, they cannot buy a trial package.

- Once a package is subscribed, it cannot be canceled. The school's upcoming package will be the same as the current package by default.

- School admins can update the current package. If a school admin updates the current package, the new package will start immediately. School admins can cancel or update the upcoming plan as well.

- School admins will have allowed days set by the super admin to pay previous bills. If a school admin fails to pay the bills within the given time, the school will be deactivated and any active package will be canceled as well.

- School admins can buy add-ons if needed. Once an add-on is added in the current cycle, it cannot be canceled. Add-ons will expire with the subscribed package.
