# Manage Teachers

![e-School SaaS](../../static/images/schooladmin/create-teacher.png)

- If a school has any active package at the time of adding a teacher, the school admin can change the status of the teacher (active or de-active). If the school doesn't have a package, the status of the teacher will be considered as de-active by default.

- School admins can only activate teachers if the school has an active package. Once a teacher is activated, they will be added to the bill.

- School admins can update or delete teachers. If a school admin deletes a teacher, they will be removed permanently. School admins need to delete other data related to teachers before deleting them.

- Teachers can login using the given email and password. The mobile number of the teacher will be the default password.

- Admins can manage teacher salaries by adding allowances or deductions, ensuring accurate payroll adjustments for each staff member.
