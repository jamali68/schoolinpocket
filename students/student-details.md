![e-School SaaS](../../static/images/schooladmin/list-students.png)

- School admins can view all students by class-section and session year.

- School admins can only activate students if the school has an active package. Once a student is activated, they will be added to the bill.

- School admins can update or delete students. If a school admin deletes a student, they will be removed permanently.
