- If a school has any active package at the time of adding a student, the school admin can change the status of the student (active or de-active). If the school doesn't have a package, the status of the student will be considered as de-active by default.

- At the time of adding a new student, school admins can search for guardians by email and assign them to the newly added student. If there is no guardian with the searched email, the school admin can create a new guardian along with the student.
