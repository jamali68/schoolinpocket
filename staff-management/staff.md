# Staff

![e-School SaaS](../../static/images/schooladmin/create-staff.png)

- The default password for staff members is their mobile number.

- If a school has any active package at the time of adding staff, school admins can change the status of the staff (active or de-active). If the school doesn't have a package, the status of the staff will be considered as de-active by default.

- School admins can only activate staff if the school has an active package. Once staff is activated, they will be added to the bill.

- School admins can update or delete staff members. If a school admin deletes a staff member, they will be removed permanently. School admins need to delete other data related to staff before deleting them.
