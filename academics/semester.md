# Semester

![e-School SaaS](../../static/images/schooladmin/semester.png)

School admins can manage semesters here. Months occupied in any one semester should not be used in another semester.

- Correct example: First semester (January-June) - Second semester (July-December)
- Incorrect example: First semester (January-July) - Second semester (June-December). Here, the month of June is added in both semesters, which is not correct.
