## Assign Subject to Class

![e-School SaaS](../../static/images/schooladmin/assign-class-subject.png)

Here, school admins can assign subjects to classes. Classes can have core and optional subjects. Core subjects are compulsory subjects for students.

Subject that is part of the core group can't be part of the optional group and vice versa.
